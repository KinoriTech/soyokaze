## Introduction

Soyokaze provides a minimal and simple starting point for building a Laravel application with authentication. Styled with
[Metro 4](https://metroui.org.ua), Soyokaze publishes authentication controllers and views to your application that can be
easily customized based on your own application's needs.

Soyokaze is a fork of [Laravel Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze).

Kinori Tech's Soyokaze is powered by Blade and Metro. If you're looking for a more robust Laravel starter kit that includes two factor authentication, Livewire / Inertia support, and more, check out [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com).
